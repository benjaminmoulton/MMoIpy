# MMoIpy
A python implementation of a method for calculating the mass, center of gravity (CG), and mass moments of inertia of an aircraft system. An aircraft can be completely modeled by summing spheres, cuboids, cylinders, wing segments, and rotors. This implementation can be used to determine the mass properties of an aircraft system. More information on the development of this method can be found in:
